================

Just my personal site. Using Poet as a _super_-basic CMS with node.

This is me getting comfortable with
- node.js
- stylus+nib
- zepto.js over jQuery (because why not?)
- markdown (clearly I'm enjoying markdown)
- Poet
- public github repositories
- eventually blogging

Coming from a crash (job) course in PHP+jQuery and years of tinkering with HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

Intending to use Poet for more conventional blog posts as well as projects and other things. Will eventually include an (interactive?) resume and stuff.
